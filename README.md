# hello-world
This is my introduction, for GitHub users, on me, as a person, and a programming enthusiast.
I'm currently studying for web development, definitley a script kiddie, if that.
I plan to eventually be an entrepeneur, and create my own successful business, not sure what it will be on yet, but issa longterm goal.
I am ecstatic about learning more and more and more. I wanna know how to do as much as possible, from databases, security, to gaming.
I wanna push code to the limits. I wanna reach the boundaries and test them, and exceed.
Super chill :D AMOSC rubdeez
I'm 19
Not your typical programming enthusiast :P
